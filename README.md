Signingscript
==============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-releng/treescript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mozilla-releng/treescript) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mozilla-releng/treescript/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mozilla-releng/treescript?branch=master)

This is designed to be run from scriptworker, but runs perfectly fine as a standalone script.


Docs
----
`README.md` is the master readme, and `README.rst` is generated via

    pandoc --from=markdown --to=rst README.md > README.rst

This is purely because

1. @Callek prefers writing markdown, and
1. pypi appears to deal with rst better than markdown.
